Japjot's Solutions to Advent of Code 2025

I am doing a personal challenge where I try to code in a different language every day.

This is a way for me to revise some key concepts as well as to gain exposure to new languages every day.


| Day 1 | C++ | Task 1 Done | Task 2 Done |
|-------|-----|-------------|-------------|
| Day 2 |     |             |             |
|       |     |             |             |
|       |     |             |             |
